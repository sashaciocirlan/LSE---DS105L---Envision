## üìù Executive Summary
This project utilized data from streaming platforms' APIs, including Spotify and Billboard, to examine the influence of streaming services on the music industry. The project aimed to understand the evolution of audio features, changes in artist popularity, and potential correlations between audio feature trends and popular music trends.<br>
Through five key steps, the project explored these aspects. Step 1 involved analyzing the top 10 artists over the past 5 years using Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Step 2 focused on collecting data on the audio features of the top 50 songs per month during this period. Step 3 examined the audio features of the top ten artists' songs over the past five years.In Step 4, industry benchmarks were established by calculating average values and standard deviations or ranges of audio feature categories. This identified the audio features that experienced the most and least change over time. Finally, in Step 5, the analysis from Step 4 was compared to the audio features of the top ten artists' songs, using visualizations like scatter plots and radar graphs to represent the findings.<br>
The findings hold significance for artists, industry professionals, and streaming platforms. Understanding evolving audio feature preferences and artist popularity informs decision-making for song production, marketing, and playlist curation. Exploring correlations between audio feature trends and popular music trends contributes to predicting future music preferences and shaping the industry's direction.<br>
In conclusion, this project harnessed data from streaming platforms to investigate the impact of streaming services on the music industry. By analyzing audio features and artist popularity, valuable insights were gained into the evolution of music preferences and potential connections with overall trends. These findings offer practical implications for decision-making in the music industry and contribute to its growth and success.
