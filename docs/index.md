# _Leader or Follower_: Exploring the Relationship Between Popular Artists and Music Trends

## üìù Executive Summary
This project utilised data from streaming platforms' APIs, including Spotify and Billboard, to examine the influence of streaming services on the music industry. The project aimed to understand the evolution of audio features, changes in artist popularity, and potential correlations between audio feature trends and popular music trends.<br>
Through five key steps, the project explored these aspects.
* Analysing the top 10 artists over the past 5 years using the Billboard's Hot 100 chart. 
* Collecting data on the audio features of the top 50 songs per month during this period. 
* Examining the audio features of the top ten artists' songs over the past five years.
* Establishing industry benchmarks by calculating average values and standard deviations or ranges of audio feature categories. This identifies the audio features that experienced the most and least change over time. 
* Comparing the analysis from Step 4 to the audio features of the top ten artists' songs, using visualizations like scatter plots and radar graphs to represent the findings.<br>
The findings hold significance for artists, industry professionals, and streaming platforms. Understanding evolving audio feature preferences and artist popularity informs decision-making for song production, marketing, and playlist curation. Exploring correlations between audio feature trends and popular music trends contributes to predicting future music preferences and shaping the industry's direction.<br>
In conclusion, this project harnessed data from streaming platforms to investigate the impact of streaming services on the music industry. By analyzing audio features and artist popularity, valuable insights were gained into the evolution of music preferences and potential connections with overall trends. These findings offer practical implications for decision-making in the music industry and contribute to its growth and success.

## üîã Motivation
Streaming services have brought about a significant transformation in the music industry, offering users convenient and cost-effective access to a vast catalog of songs. These services play a pivotal role in shaping artist visibility, revenue streams, and listening preferences. Moreover, the publicly available APIs provided by streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music offer unparalleled insights into various dimensions, including geography, audio features, and time, shedding light on trends among both artists and listeners.<br>
<br>
Throughout our project, we embarked with a set of guiding questions:<br>
* What are the most popular audio features, and how have they evolved over time?<br>
* How has the popularity of artists changed over time?<br>
* Is there a correlation between the evolution of audio features among top artists and the overall trends in popular music?<br>
<br>
While not all of these questions fell strictly within the scope of our analysis, they served as initial guiding points. Ultimately, our collective interest in music propelled us to undertake this project. Specifically, we sought to understand how, if at all, music has evolved over the last five years, and how the most popular artists' own stylistic choices relate to this evolution.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Data Sources
We used two sources of data for our research:<br>
* Billboard (Billboard API) via Python Package (pypi.python.org/pypi/billboard.py) 
* Spotify (Spotify API) (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)<br>

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
### Billboard API
In Step 1, our objective was to investigate the top 10 artists of the past 5 years using Billboard‚Äôs weekly ‚ÄòBillboard Hot 100‚Äô chart. Below is a cropped screenshot of the Billboard chart.<br>

### Spotify API
Similarly, we looked at the Spotify API to investigate the audio features of the top 50 songs per month over the past five years. We used the "Weekly Top Songs Global" chart generated by Spotify every Thursday, which shows the 200 most streamed songs worldwide of the week. Data were collected from 2018/05/24, and we observed a total of 66 charts: every 4 weeks for 5 years. The "Get several tracks' audio features" request in the API allowed us to acquire the audio features of up to 100 tracks.<br>
Below is a screenshot of an example of the Spotify CSV Files from Microsoft Excel, showing the most-streamed songs on the week of 2018/05/24.<br>

<br>
#### Audio Features
We followed the definition of audio features provided by Spotify: (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features)<br>
* Danceability - how suitable a track is for dancing (0 is least danceable, 1 is most danceable)
* Energy - perceptual measure of intensity and activity (0 is least energetic, 1 is most energetic)
* Instrumentalness - how much vocals there are in a track (0 is least instrumental (ie. most vocal), 1 is most instrumental (ie. no vocals)
* Liveness - likelihood of audience present (between 0 and 1)
* Loudness - loudness of a track in decibels (dB) (higher values = louder)
* Acousticness - how acoustic a track is (acoustic: no electrical amplification)
* Speechiness - how much spoken word there is in a track (0 is least (only music), 1 is most (no music, only speaking), rap music would fall in between)
* Tempo - tempo of the track in beats per minute (higher means the track is faster)
* Valence - the musical happiness conveyed by the track (0 is saddest, 1 is happiest)
* Duration_ms - the duration of the song in milliseconds



Step 3: 
In Step 3, our objective was to analyze the audio features of the top ten artists' songs from the past five years.


## üí™üèº Data Collection Challenges
Throughout the data collection section of our investigation our team encountered several challenges. However, through diligent problem-solving and collaboration, our team successfully devised solutions for each of these challenges.<br>

Challenge|Solution|Outcome
:---|:---|:---
One major hurdle was the absence of a direct Billboard API, which was terminated in May 2013. Therefore, we could not retrieve the aggregated data or directly use Billboard's resources for aggregation.|We found a Python package, Billboard.py, on StackOverflow which helped us aggregate the data. With this, we could identify the ten artists with the most entries on the weekly charts over the past five years.|This underlined the value of leveraging existing solutions to overcome data analysis problems and avoid needing to reinvent the wheel. Forums like StackOverflow are particularly helpful for this.
Directly searching for the most popular artists was not possible as the Billboard Hot 100 features popular songs rather than individual artists.|We incorporated an extra step of identifying the artist behind each entry, and then we summed up all artists' songs total number of entries throught 5 years (52 Top 100 charts/year) |We got a strong indicator of the top 10 artists in the past 5 years (e.g. Drake has over 800 total entries in all charts) and we used the Top 10 list we compiled as a baseline for further analysis.
Spotify's weekly charts did not provide easy access to their historical data, making it challenging for us to collect the required information.|After extensive research, we discovered that Spotify's historical data was stored in CSV files (insert photo). Therefore, we manually downloaded the CSV files and imported them into pandas dataframes for analysis.|This process taught us a valuable lesson about the accessibility of data. It served as a reminder that data is often not readily available and may require substantial effort to obtain. Additionally, we recognized the importance of data transformation when working with diverse data sources, as traditional organizations may employ storage formats that are less convenient but contain vital data, that data scientists have to work with while conducting analysis or transitioning an organization to a more modern data storage method. 
We encountered a collaboration issue as there was a misalignment in our variable names and general code style. This lack of coherence in our functions between group members initially prevented us from collecting the data. For instance, one collaborator used the variable name 'Artist' while another used 'Top Ten Artist'.|To resolve this issue, we carefully reviewed and adjusted the variable names to ensure consistency. This enabled us to successfully execute the code.|Although seemingly minor, we argue that this is a common yet deceptively difficult challenge faced by data scientists when collaborating. As a result, we adopted a practice of establishing a baseline 'style' at the beginning of each collaborative coding session, which greatly streamlined the process.


## üìà Data Analysis

### Determining "Industry Benchmarks"
(Rough) The objective of this stage is to establish "industry benchmarks" regarding global listening patterns. To achieve this, a weighted average of all the audio feature values for each chart will be computed. The intention is to demonstrate the overall significance of the audio features for each chart, such as determining the overall danceability value of the top 50 songs on a specific date, like 2018-05-24. Since the weekly charts indicate the number of streams received by a song, this information can be utilized to calculate a weighted average of the audio feature values. The weighted average is calculated by multiplying each song's audio feature value by its corresponding number of streams, adding up all 50 values, and dividing the sum by the total number of streams for the 50 songs. Consequently, the resulting dataframe will contain both the initial and final sections.
### Comparison
(Rough) First we get the overall average values for the most popular songs (Just get the mean of the values in the above dataframe). We use Sasha‚Äôs dataframe with the values for the top 10 artists: for each audio feature, we substract the overall average and the resulting value would be the difference between top artists and the industry benchmark.



## Methodology: 
1. Fetch the audio features for the top songs of the top artists
2. Calculate the average audio features for each top artist
3. Convert the artist data into a DataFrame
